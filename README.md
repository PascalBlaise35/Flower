# Flower I created this class diagram for the 'Flower' class as part of my Module 11 - Task 4 hands-on practice. It shows the attributes ('color,' 'size,' and 'type') and methods ('bloom(),' 'wither(),' and 'photosynthesize()') of a flower in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) format. I also added my name and today's date in a textbox, as required. The file is saved as BlaiseFlowerClass.pdf, and itâ€™s part of my growing IT portfolio.
